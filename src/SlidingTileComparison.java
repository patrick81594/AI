/**
 * See comments below first.  Then, return back up here.
 *
 * STEP 9: Save the output of your program (STEP 8) to a text file, and include that file when you submit your assignment.
 *
 * STEP 10: Answer this question in this comment:
 *
 *     Question: Part of your step 8 should confirm the effect we saw in class that a more informed heuristic leads to fewer state expansions.
 *               Does it also have an effect on memory usage (i.e., number of generated states)?
 *
 *      Answer: Yes, it seems like it has an effect on memory usage essentially causing it to decrease dramatically for the most informed heuristic in A*Man
 *
 *
 * EXTRA CREDIT INSTRUCTIONS:
 * You do not need to do all of the extra credit parts.  You can: (a) do none of them and thus get no extra credit, (b) do EXTRA CREDIT STEPS 11 and 12,
 * (c) do EXTRA CREDIT STEPS 13 through 16, or (d) do EXTRA CREDIT STEPS 11 through 16.  Those are the only valid combinations of extra credit parts.
 *
 * EXTRA CREDIT STEP 11: Add code to the main method below to compute the average CPU time, and to output a 3rd table for the average CPU time.
 *                       Make sure your output in STEP 9 includes this additional table.
 * EXTRA CREDIT STEP 12: Answer this question in this comment:
 *     Question: More informed heuristics lead to fewer state expansions, but more informed heuristics typically require more time to compute,
 *               so may or may not be better to use.  Based on your timing results, is the added cost of computing Manhattan Distance worthwhile?
 *
 * EVEN MORE EXTRA CREDIT STEP 13: Implement another heuristic function in the SlidingTilePuzzleSolver file, specifically this additional heuristic
 *    function should compute: a * h(s) where h(s) is the Manhattan Distance for state s, and where a >= 1.  The class that implements this heuristic
 *    function will need a constructor enabling passing a (you can't change the signature line of the h method).
 * EVEN MORE EXTRA CREDIT STEP 14: Add whatever code is necessary to your main method below to have an additional column for A*h3 to your tables
 *   (make sure you update the text file you submit for STEP 9).  You can decide on the value of a, but it should be relatively close to 1,
 *   such as 1.1, 1.2, etc.
 * EVEN MORE EXTRA CREDIT STEP 15: Desscribe in this comment any cost savings from using this heuristic relative to using Manhattan Distance.
 * EVEN MORE EXTRA CREDIT STEP 16: Also in this comment, indicate whether this heuristic is admissible.
 *

        //   At each of those lengths, average the number of states expanded by UniformCostSearch and average the number of states generated
        //   by Uniform Cost Search (if STEPS 3, 5, and 6 are correct, you can get these with the methods getNumExpandedStates and getNumGeneratedStates).

        //   The A*h2 likewise should have those averages for A* with manhattan distance.
        //
        //   After you run your program, you should find that the UCS number of expanded states is the highest, followed by
        //   A*h1, and A*h2 should have the lowest number of expanded states (assuming your STEPS 1 through 6 are correct)
        //   since number of misplaced tiles is more informed than no heuristic (UCS), and Manhattan distance is more informed
        //   than number of misplaced tiles.

        //   REMINDER: An integer divided by an integer only gives you the whole number portion of the result, so be careful when
        //             computing the averages since number of expanded states and number of generated states are integers.
