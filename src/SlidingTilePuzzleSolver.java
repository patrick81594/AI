/**
 * In this assignment, you will implement Uniform Cost Search as well as A* Search for Sliding Tile Puzzles (i.e., 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle, etc).
 * Find the comments that begin with "STEP 1" etc for detailed instructions on what you are to implement.
 *
 * You may work on this either individually or in pairs (your choice).  If working on this as a pair, both get same grade.
 *
 * STEPS 1 through 6 are in this Java file.  I recommend doing them in the order I've numbered them.
 *
 * STEP 7 (Strongly recommended, but optional step): Implement some code to test your searches.  The constructor of SlidingTilePuzzle has a parameter
 *    for specifying the distance the puzzle's start is from the goal.  Since both Uniform Cost Search and A* with an admissible heuristic
 *    are optimal, your method from STEP 3 should return a path of that length.  Additionally, if your STEPS 1, 2, and 4 are correct, then
 *    the methods I provided (which depend on those), AStarSearchMisplacedTiles and AStarSearchManhattanDistance, should also produce
 *    the optimal path.
 *
 * STEPS 8 through 10 are in the file SlidingTileComparison.
