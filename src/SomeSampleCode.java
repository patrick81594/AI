        // If you need to change the priority of an element already in the priority queue, simply call offer again.
        // If the priority is lower than the current one, it will decrease it.  Otherwise, it will leave it alone.

        SlidingTilePuzzle puzzle3 = pq.poll();


        // For both Uniform Cost Search and A*, you will need a MinHeapPQ as your frontier (the states awaiting expansion).
        // However, for every state we've ever generated, we need to keep track of the best f value (for A*) or the best g value (for uniform cost search)
        // that we have previously seen.  Additionally, we need to keep track of the backpointer that corresponds with that f or g value.
        // Backpointer is just the state we were at previously along the relevant path.
        // I recommend using Java's HashMap class for this.  You can either maintain one HashMap for the f values and one for the backpointers.
        // Or you can declare a cimple class that contains those two values and then just have a single HashMap.

        // Here's an example of how you might declare a HashMap to keep track of previous f values.
        // i.e., mapping puzzles to integers.
        HashMap<SlidingTilePuzzle, Integer> generatedSet = new HashMap<SlidingTilePuzzle, Integer>();

        // You can then add to it with put:
        generatedSet.put(puzzle, 4);

        // You can check if you've seen a puzzle state previously with something like:
        if (generatedSet.containsKey(puzzle)) {

        }

        // you can find a state's f value with get
